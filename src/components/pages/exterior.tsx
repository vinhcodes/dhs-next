      question: "HOW LONG DOES EXTERIOR PAINTING TAKE IN FLORIDA?",
      answer:
        "Most exterior painting projects take 5-10 days depending on home size and weather conditions. Single-story homes typically require 4-6 days, while two-story homes need 7-10 days. We build in buffer time for Florida's afternoon storms and high humidity. Weather delays are common but we work efficiently during optimal conditions to stay on schedule.",

      question: "WHAT EXTERIOR PAINT WORKS BEST IN FLORIDA'S CLIMATE?",
      answer:
        "We use premium exterior paints specifically engineered for extreme weather conditions. Our go-to systems include Sherwin-Williams Duration and Benjamin Moore Aura - both offer maximum UV resistance, mildew prevention, and hurricane-grade adhesion. These paints are formulated to withstand Florida's brutal sun, coastal salt air, and severe weather while maintaining color integrity for 10-15 years.",

We typically avoid starting projects during active storm watches but can work safely during calm periods. Our hurricane-resistant paint systems are actually designed to be applied year-round in Florida.",
