      question: "HOW MUCH DOES CABINET PAINTING COST IN TAMPA BAY?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
          <p>
            Cabinet painting in Tampa Bay typically costs $3,000-8,000 for a
            full kitchen, depending on cabinet size, condition, and finish
            complexity. This is 60-80% less expensive than full cabinet
            replacement, which often costs $15,000-40,000.

      question: "HOW LONG DOES CABINET PAINTING TAKE?",
      answer:
        "Most cabinet painting projects take 4-7 days to complete. We remove doors and drawers for 2-3 days of workshop finishing, while painting cabinet boxes in your home takes 1-2 days. Final installation and touch-ups require 1 additional day. We work efficiently to minimize kitchen disruption and can often coordinate with your schedule for optimal convenience.",

      id: "cabinet-durability",
      question: "HOW LONG WILL MY PAINTED CABINETS LAST?",
      answer:
        "With proper preparation and premium cabinet-grade paints, painted cabinets can last 10-15 years or more. We use high-durability finishes specifically designed for kitchen environments - resistant to moisture, grease, and daily wear. Our 5-year guarantee covers chipping, peeling, and normal kitchen use when properly maintained.",
    },
    {
      id: "cabinet-materials",
      question: "WHAT TYPE OF PAINT DO YOU USE FOR KITCHEN CABINETS?",
      answer:
        "We use premium cabinet-specific paints like Benjamin Moore Advance and Sherwin-Williams ProClassic. These are hybrid enamel paints that cure to an extremely hard, smooth finish perfect for kitchen use. They're self-leveling, which eliminates brush marks, and provide superior durability against moisture, heat, and daily cleaning.",

      answer:
        "Cabinet painting is ideal if your cabinet boxes are structurally sound but outdated in appearance. You'll save 60-80% compared to replacement while achieving a completely fresh look. Replacement is better for damaged cabinets or major layout changes. During our consultation, I'll honestly assess whether painting or replacement is the better investment for your specific situation.",
